Synergy provides a simple interface for maintenance of student–alumni information. It can be used by educational institutes or colleges to keep students connected to their alumni. Keeping the students in touch with their alumni regarding a students’ academic career is critically important in the university as well as colleges. Synergy deals with all the information of student and alumni regarding their areas of interest and domains they are working in. It collects all the career oriented information of students and alumni and recommends people around. It recommends both students and alumni whose profiles match according to the similarity in areas of interest. It also facilitate us to connect to anyone we are interested in. This platform is all about guiding a student for his/her career by connecting them to all the student and alumni they can work with or approach for help.
